      <h3>Thanks!</h3>

          <p>A project like this rests on a deep stack of impressive work
          freely shared by a multitude of others.  This page is where we
          thank those people and encourage you to check out their other
          work.</p>

          <ul>
          <li>I photoshopped the Planeteria logo 
          in <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>
          from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wwworks/2222523486/">a
          public domain photo</a> found on Flickr.</li>

          <li>The <a href="/pub.d/images/silhouette2.png">Unknown Blogger
          avatar</a> is based on a photo I
          gimped off of Flickr.  Unfortunately, <a
          href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/n-o-n-o/3502226571">the link</a> went dead and I
          can no longer find it.  All of <a
          href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/n-o-n-o/">Nono Fara's
          photos</a> are beautiful, though, so poke through her stream for
          some nice shots.</li>

          <li>I originally based this software on <a
          href="http://www.planetplanet.org/">Planet Planet</a>, but quickly
          moved to build instead on <a
          href="http://intertwingly.net/code/venus/">Venus</a>.  Later I
          discarded those dependencies for more flexibility, but my code is
          less robust as a result.  Venus is good stuff and if you're only
          running one planet, I highly recommend it.</li>

          <li>The bulk of the CSS on this site is from a template called
          FreshPick by <a href="http://www.styleshout.com/">Erwin
          Aligam</a>.  Some form-specific CSS came from <a
          href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/prettyaccessibleforms/">A
          List Apart</a>.  I also grabbed some from <a
          href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2007/05/01/reset-
          reloaded/">Eric Meyer</a>.</li>

          <li>I scavenged some Javascript from the web: <a
          href="http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum91/441.htm">hidediv</a>.</li>

          <li>I grabbed this <a
          href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/82465/">mkdir</a>
          routine.</li>
