        <h3>Terms of Use</h3>
            <p>By accessing this site, you agree to the following terms:</p>

            <p>You grant me (James Vasile) a worldwide, perpetual,
            sublicensable royalty-free license to reprint any content you
            contribute to this site, in verbatim or modified form, and in any
            medium.  This doesn't include stuff we pull in via rss and
            atom.</p>

            <p>This website inevitably collects some data about users, both in
            server logs and in the content you contribute. I won't share your
            data with spammers.</p>

            <p>You agree not to rely on this site for anything crucial.  It
            might disappear or break without notice and I'm making no
            commitment to maintain it or fix it quickly (or ever).  If you
            want reliability, talk to me and we'll come up with something that
            works.</p>

            <p>I store your password as plain, unobfuscated text in my
            database.  Please do not use a real password on this site.
            Security ranges from lax to nonexistent.  It's just feeds, and
            it's not worth the effort of real security.</p>

            <p>If your planet is inactive (i.e. nobody is
            pulling the feed or viewing the planet page on a regular basis),
            I'm probably going to delete it to conserve resources.</p>

            <p>The email address you enter is viewable by anybody who comes to
            your admin page or pulls your feed.  Feel free to lie about your
            address.</p>

            <p>From time to time, I might add new terms here.  You agree to
            watch this page for changes and be bound by those new terms.</p>
